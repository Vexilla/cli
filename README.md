# Vexilla CLI

This tool is meant to encompass any of the boilerplate and tasks that go along with using the Vexilla Feature Flag System.

## Scope

Currently this tool is only meant to generate consts/enums for feature flag keys and groups from your own Vexilla-created json file. The goal is to reduce the amount of "magic strings" in your code.

## Usage

The easiest way to use this tool is via NPM:

```
npx @vexilla/cli npx @vexilla/cli types -i https://mealection-feature-flags.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/features.json -o ./temp/foo.dart -l dart
```

You can also download a binary for your platform from: [https://github.com/Vexilla/cli/releases](https://github.com/Vexilla/cli/releases)
